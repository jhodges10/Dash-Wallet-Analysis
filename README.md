# Dash-Wallet-Analysis
Code for analyzing Dash Wallet addresses to look at spending habits.

# Preparation
You'll want to play with the `csv_to_read_wallet` methid in analysis.py in order to have it match the CSV you're giving it correctly.

The code is designed to loop through every address in the given list and look to see how much money was sent to an an adresss, and how much was sent out. So depending on your needs, you might need to change some things.

# Graphing
The graphing code is in the plot.py file and runs against the analysis.csv file created in the analysis.py file.
